# WolframHowl
Code behind an application for the Amazon Echo which will take natural language in the form of a question and answer it through using the Wolfram API. Simply tell Echo, a voice controlled AI, to open the app and then simply ask a question, whether it be about math, science, or even biographies. Wolfram Howl (our app) will be able to answer it quickly and correctly. (Full project is too large to upload to Github. Download zip file to get all files) Last modified: 3/26/17
