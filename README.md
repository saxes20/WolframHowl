# Wolfram Howl
Code behind our skill for the Amazon Echo which will take natural language in the form of a question and answer it through using the Wolfram API. Simply tell Echo, a voice controlled AI, to open the app and then just ask a question, whether it be about math, science, or even biographies. Wolfram Howl (our app) will be able to answer it quickly and correctly by formatting and sending the request to Wolfram and returning a JSON to turn into an answer.
